## How the Location Sharing Works?
- The device gets its continous location updates from GPS using the Google Maps API.
- Location data for the user is updated in their respective firestore documents, and subsequently in the group documents.
- Other devices sharing goups with the first user read that firebase firestore document and show the marker in the stored location.
